# Scene-Extension-Outpainting-and-Inpainting-with-Stable-Diffusion
This project demonstrates how to extend an image's scene seamlessly using outpainting with Pillow and inpainting with the Stable Diffusion model from the diffusers library. The process involves adding padding around the original image and then using AI to generate contextually coherent extensions of the scene.
